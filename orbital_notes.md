# Notes for orbital simulations 
## K:
+ The sweet spot looks like its around the inclination of 55
+ Only Changing inclination doesnt really give a good answer 
+ long asc node seems good place to start 
+ SaVi sattelite architecture follow:
	+ `semi-major axis| eccentricity | inclination | longitude asc. node | argument of periapsis | time of periapsis | sat name `
## Q:
+ what diff should i use for multiple satiletes?
	+ Maybe just different launch time? 
	+ Then what is the "GOOD" time, when will the sat arrive back to the same point over the earth?
