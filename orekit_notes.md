# Orekit:

+ Sadly in java, so i have to get to its nooks and stuff
+ Promising tutorial templates: VisibilityCheck.java and SlaveMode.java, first one basically gives me what i need the second gives me a modell thats close enought for SaVi's J2 propagation modell that it can be easily converted 
+ Todo:
	+ SaVi -> Orekit Converter
	+ Setup eventhandler for satellite visibility 
+ Future TODO:
	+ get historical weather data for sat pos
