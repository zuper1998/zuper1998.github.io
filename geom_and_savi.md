# SaVi - Sat constelation visualization 
### Features: 
+ Satellite orbit and groundtracking with coverage visualization
	+ setable angle for coverage 
+ premade but editable satellite constellations 
+ easily generate satellite constelations
+ you can use the Ballard Rosette tool to generate Rosette constellations!

### Would be nice to have
+ The possibilty to export to TLE 

### Download and Install 
Download the development version from https://savi.sourceforge.io/, then by following the instalation manual install it along with geomview. Without GeomView its not that good. 

### USE> 
1. After installing run `geomview` then select SaVi from the External modules list (its on the tab which is all grey) 
2. Load a constellation or type in a new one with CTRL+N & CTRL+E 
3. Have fun
