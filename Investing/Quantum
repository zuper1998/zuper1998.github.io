## Superconducting qbits
small coherence time 
Companies: GOOGLE, IBM, Rigetti
IBM: 60 qubits -- 1000 qbits till 2023
## Photonic qbits
THe shi i do
Room temperature 
Coherence can be big 
Can get Large quickly
Companies: Xanadu, PsiQuantum 
PsiQuantum -- photonic quantum circuits -- they dont say how :D

## Ion traps
atom missing an electron
moving them with lasers
Doesnt need rly low temps only a few kelvins (0K ~ -273C)
Companies: Honeywell, IONQ
PRO:
Coherence
Can interact with more neighbors
CON: 
SLow 
Few

## D-Wave qbits 
Company
5600 qbits 
Sells actual computers
Purpose built computers 

## TOpological quantum computing 
Quasi particles as information storing method

PRO:
Literaly everything 

Con:
NNothing? 

Company: Microsoft



## Far field
Semi Conducting qbits -- electrons, few kelwins enough 

Nitrogen Vacancy System -- room temp, QuTech
