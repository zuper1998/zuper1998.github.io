### PRO 
+ Really detailed simulation enviroment 
+ multiple example codes and guides
+ Groundtrack!
+ supports manouvers
+ modular, configurable


### CON
+ steep learning curve 
+ since its not a complete software like SaVi you will have to code most of the things yourself


### Install:
1. SInce it uses anaconda as a main module it is fairly simple to install, if you dont have anaconda you can easily install it with `brew install miniconda` or on ubuntu simply by following [this](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-anaconda-on-ubuntu-20-04/) tutorial
2. After installing conda you need 2 more stepts: 
3. `wget https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_downloads/2ff196b0ef4830f53d754f6a3972d2e8/environment.yaml`
